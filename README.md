# Sabaac Game - Corellian Spike Edition

Welcome to the **Sabaac Game - Corellian Spike Edition**! This project includes two versions of the classic Star Wars card game Sabaac:

1. **Console Version (`sabaac_console.py`)**: Play the game in your terminal.
2. **Discord Bot Version (`sabaac_droid.py`)**: Play the game on Discord with friends using a bot.

This version of the game is inspired by the one found in _Solo: A Star Wars Story_ and sold at Galaxy's Edge, where Han Solo famously won the Millennium Falcon from Lando Calrissian.
